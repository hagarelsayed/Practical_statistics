### Introduction to Five Number Summary

Calculating the 5 Number Summary
The five-number summary consist of 5 values:

- Minimum: The smallest number in the dataset
- Q1: The value such that 25% of the data fall below.
- Q2: The value such that 50% of the data fall below.
- Q3 The value such that 75% of the data fall below.
- Maximum: The largest value in the dataset.

 we saw that calculating each of these values was essentially just finding the median of a bunch of different datasets. Because we are essentially calculating a bunch of medians, the calculation depends on whether we have an odd or even number of values.

Range
The range is then calculated as the difference between the maximum and the minimum.

IQR
The interquartile range is calculated as the difference between Q3-Q1

<img scr="./Images/Screenshot (1179).png" width = "100" >  
 #You can also specify height but only one of them to maintain the aspect ratio.
