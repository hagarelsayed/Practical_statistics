## What is the Pie?

the pie is how much more the two parties can create by working together compared to what they can create without an agreement. How much can they get by working together? How much can Abe get on his own? How much can Bea get on her own? Try again. 

- Now imagine that Abe can get 6 on his own, Bea can get 2 on her own, and together they can get 9. What is the pie?

    - That's right. The pie is how much more the two parties can create by working together compared to what they can create without an agreement. So, 9 - (6 + 2) = 1.


- Abe and Bea are thirsty. Abe has 60¢ and Bea has $1.00 to spend on a drink. With the money he has, Abe would buy a 6-oz. bottled water for 60¢ and Bea would buy a 16-oz. bottled water for $1.00. However, if they pool their funds, they can buy a 32-oz. bottled water for $1.60
    - " 10" If they don't work together, the two of them will get 6 + 16 = 22 ounces of water. If they do work together, they can increase their water to 32 ounces. Thus they gain 10 ounces of water by coming
together.
