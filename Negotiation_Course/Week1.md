## What is the Pie?

the pie is how much more the two parties can create by working together compared to what they can create without an agreement. How much can they get by working together? How much can Abe get on his own? How much can Bea get on her own? Try again. 

- Now imagine that Abe can get 6 on his own, Bea can get 2 on her own, and together they can get 9. What is the pie?

    - That's right. The pie is how much more the two parties can create by working together compared to what they can create without an agreement. So, 9 - (6 + 2) = 1.


- Abe and Bea are thirsty. Abe has 60¢ and Bea has $1.00 to spend on a drink. With the money he has, Abe would buy a 6-oz. bottled water for 60¢ and Bea would buy a 16-oz. bottled water for $1.00. However, if they pool their funds, they can buy a 32-oz. bottled water for $1.60
    - " 10" If they don't work together, the two of them will get 6 + 16 = 22 ounces of water. If they do work together, they can increase their water to 32 ounces. Thus they gain 10 ounces of water by coming
together.


### Question 
Recall Abe has 60¢ and Bea has $1.00 to spend on a drink. With the money he has, Abe would buy a 6-oz. bottled water for 60¢ and Bea would buy a 16-oz. bottled water for $1.00. However, if they pool their funds, they can buy a 32-oz. bottled water for $1.60. How much water do we expect Abe will get as a result of the negotiation?

Note: Abe and Bea have a 7-oz. cup on hand to help divide up the water.


#### Answer 
That’s right. The pie is 10 oz. To get that extra 10 oz., Bea needs Abe just as much as Abe needs Bea. Thus I think it should be split equally. In that case, Abe would get 6 + 5 = 11 oz. You can give yourself a bonus if you figured out how they could use the 7-oz. cup to do the division: Bea can take three cups (21 oz.), leaving Abe with the remaining 11 ounces.

This problem is a small stakes version of a real negotiation. Two couples were each looking for an apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On their own, one was looking to buy a two-bedroom apartment for $600,000, and the other was looking to buy a three-bedroom apartment for $800,000. (I've rounded the numbers.) As the two couples were friends, they considered buying a two-family home together. They soon found a house they both liked for $1.2 million. One half was two bedrooms, and the other half was three bedrooms. Everyone was happy. But they had to figure out how to split the purchase price. 

One option was to use the ratio of bedrooms, 3:2, or the ratio of the square footage, which was about 5:4. Another was the ratio of what would have been their separate purchases, or 4:3. After thinking about the ideas here, they agreed to split the gains evenly. Buying the two-family home created a $200,000 savings or pie. Neither couple could get this savings without the other. Thus the two-bedroom half was charged $500,000, and the three-bedroom half was charged $700,000. So, the ratio was 7:5.

Of course, it is hardly worth your while to negotiate over how to split trivial items such as a 32-oz. water bottle. But if you get the principle down and start seeing the world this way, you can apply this same approach when the stakes really matter.
